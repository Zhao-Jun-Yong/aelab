## Resubmission

This is a resubmission. In this version I have fixed following issues:

* Start the description with "Facilitates the ..." instead of ""This package...".

* Omit the redundant "R" from "R functions".

* Remove unecassary linebreaks.

* Remove brand names such as LI-COR and HOBO.

* Unwrap examples if executable. Replace \dontrun with \donttest with examples that are not.

* Add raw data files to inst/extdata subfolder

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 note

* This is a new release.
